# Biomechanics Skeleton Overlay with YOLOv8 and Ultralytics


## Overview

This Python project is an exciting exploration of computer vision and biomechanics, where we leverage the power of YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) and Ultralytics to overlay a biomechanics skeleton on people captured in a webcam feed. The project also incorporates OpenCV2, a popular library often used in baseball analytics.

## Key Features

- **YOLOv8 Integration**: Utilize the efficiency of YOLOv8 for real-time object detection.
- **Ultralytics Magic**: Leverage the capabilities of Ultralytics to enhance the overall experience.
- **OpenCV2 Goodness**: Extend the project's functionality, especially suitable for baseball enthusiasts.
